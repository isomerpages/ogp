> You will have a direct hand working on things that matter. There will be opportunities to learn, contribute, and  have autonomy to work on tech for public good.

### **What does it mean to be an OGP intern?**

**Getting hands-on learning.**  We believe that the best learning is done by having our interns be hands-on working on things which matter. You will be treated like our full-timers and work alongside the rest of the product / corporate team on real products and work. We do not believe in creating theoretical research or vanity projects for interns to do, which will not see the light of day.

**Taking ownership of your work.** We believe that we hire the best and brightest, and will trust our people and interns with the autonomy to do their best work. Your will have your views treated with equal respect on the team. You will be able to push and prototype your ideas, and will be given the space to work on things you believe matter, even if we don’t assign these specific things to you. Our interns have presented their work and ideas to Ministers.

**Joining us to make an impact for public good.** Fundamentally, you will have a hand in contributing to tech for public good. You will work on things that matter, and will see how the work you’ve done directly impacts public officers and members of the public. You will also be given the opportunity to be considered for a conversion to a full-time offer, regardless whether you’re a pre-university or graduate student.

### **What do our interns do?**

We have had interns work alongside us on nearly every single product and corporate function in OGP. You will be working closely with our full-timers to contribute to existing projects. 

Whether you aspire to be part of a corporate team running tech organisations, or building tech for public good as a [Software Engineer](/careers/software-engineer/), [Product Designer](/careers/product-design/), or [Product Manager](/careers/product-management/), you will have the opportunity to experience day-to-day OGP life and contribute your skills and ideas the same way our full-timers do.

### **What we look for in our interns**

We look for the same traits in our interns that we do our full-timers - their demonstrated [Ability, Initiative, Communication, and Values](/careers/aicv/). 

We are looking for signs of passion, ability, and proactivity beyond your assigned coursework. This means we are looking to see your portfolios, personal projects, and prior work more than just your academic grades and qualifications. 

Read more about how we think about hiring [here](/careers/hiring/).

### **When do we hire interns?**

We are open to internships all year round!

We want to maintain the highest learning quality by only bringing in interns when we have willing and able intern managers to mentor them. This means that at times, we fill all our internship slots and have to temporarily close our intern openings.

You can view our openings through the link below. If you do not see an opening for your desired internship position, email us at recruiting@open.gov.sg.
