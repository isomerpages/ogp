> Hiring is the single most important thing we do. 

We believe in bringing in great people, and then giving them the autonomy to work on building tech for public good. 

Because hiring is so important, we run a hiring process focused on being fair, thorough, and transparent. We do so because we want candidates to show up at their best, and for us and our candidates to make the right call on whether we’re a good fit for one another.

### How do we run our hiring processes?

Whilst our specific hiring process varies between roles, we hold a common philosophy for how we want our prospective employees to experience our hiring process:

**You will have full knowledge of what we’re looking for and how your assessment went.** *You should have what you need to prepare, so that you can show up and interview at your best.*
* We share details on what to expect for every interview stage and what we are looking for. 
* We offer and provide feedback if requested for every candidate who has had at least one interview with us, so you know where to improve. 

**Your time should be respected through the hiring process.** *Our candidates take time off from their busy schedules to meet us, and we don’t believe in taking this courtesy for granted.* 
* We screen and respond to all applicants quickly, whether or not we proceed with their application.
* To respect the time you've set aside to spend with us, we structure all our interview components to keep things on time.
* We don't believe in running an excessive number of interviews. We run 3-4 assessment rounds (including screening) for permanent roles, and 2 rounds for internships
* Our end-to-end hiring process typically takes 3-5 weeks, mainly due to scheduling and time needed for any take home assignments. We fast track any applicants who need answers sooner (our record is 7 days from application to offer!)

**You will be evaluated on real-world performance relevant to the role, and not arbitrary nor theoretical brainteasers.** The best candidate assessments are ones which focus on how well a candidate would do in the job.
* We focus on assessing realistic workpieces such as portfolios, skill-based tests, and written assignments. 
* We ask specific role-based questions to assess how well you’d do on the job rather than just your interviewing skills.
* We do not ask ‘gotcha’ questions or random brainteasers.

**You will be assessed as fairly as possible by multiple independent assessors.** All assessments are inherently subjective. We want to make sure that we control for individual subjectivity and bias.
* We run highly structured interviews focused on real-world tasks and structured questioning. 
* For non-internship roles, we have multiple interviewers present at interview rounds. Every interviewer completes independent evaluations before a single word of discussion takes place. 
* We use structured evaluation processes and clear assessment rubrics for every interview, and discuss all evaluations before making a decision on candidates. 

**You will be assessed and offered terms based on your market worth and not your employment history.** You should be hired and paid based on the job you are able to accomplish, and not on other extraneous factors such as your years of experience, last drawn pay or education pedigree. 
* We assess you against a function-specific career schema and make offers based on your assessed level of performance. Demonstrated expertise and proven ability matter much more than factors like your education qualifications.
* We base salary offers on this assessed level of performance rather than your last drawn salary or years of experience.
* We move to promote people as quickly as possible to their assessed level of performance.
