### **Large language model powered assistant for public officers**

#### Background 

Large language models have the potential to be powerful assistants for government officers, capable of helping with a broad range of writing, research and operational tasks. 

However, there are significant challenges in using them for government work today. One of the main challenges is data security, as sensitive government information must be kept secure at all times. Additionally, there is a need for government context to ensure that Pair can provide accurate and relevant assistance to officers.

#### Solution
One of the key features of Pair is that it does not log any data on Azure, ensuring that officers can use Pair with confidence that their data is secure. 

We are also building out a file upload feature that allow officers to upload relevant government documents, providing additional context for Pair to provide more accurate and relevant assistance.

#### Impact
Within the first two months of trial launch,

* Over 11,000 users across more than 100 government agencies
* More than 4500 weekly active users
