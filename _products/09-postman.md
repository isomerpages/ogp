### An omnichannel communication tool for the Singapore Government

#### Background 

Postman.gov.sg is an omnichannel cloud-based service that Singapore government agencies can use to send personalized messages in bulk.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, government agencies needed to provide accurate and up-to-date information to citizens. To prevent the spread of false information and to reduce the potential anxiety and uncertainty citizens faced, it was important that the government could release official updates on public health measures directly on the channels that citizens were already using. Postman collaborated with the Ministry of Communications and Information to set up a WhatsApp broadcast subscription service to inform citizens of the latest updates on the number of COVID-19 cases, social distancing measures, and closure of non-essential services. Our WhatsApp initiative had over 1 million subscribers, with 3 million public announcements sent daily.

Subsequently, we built a modular omnichannel communication tool to enable agencies to quickly scale their communication needs and allow them to distribute critical information such as training and employment opportunities for those who were impacted by the economic downturn from the pandemic. 


#### Approach

* Three simple steps to send a campaign: (1) craft a message, (2) upload a contact list, and (3) click send
* Postman allows for campaign analytics, enabling the sender to track a campaign’s success, maintain and clean the contact database, and save and reuse campaign credentials.
* Postman provides password-protected messages for highly sensitive information distribution


#### Impact

* Saved over S$10 million for the Quarantine Order Program for COVID-19 disease control
* Sent over 1.3 million messages
* More than 800 users across 94 agencies
