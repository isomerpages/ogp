#### What motivated you to build SanBaiQian 三百千?
SanBaiQian 三百千 was motivated by the slipping Mandarin Chinese proficiency of Singaporeans. 

#### What was the most challenging aspect?
The consumer space for apps teaching Chinese is orders of magnitude larger than the government space and requires more time to do a competitive review on. We discovered that most of the quick wins had already been done as well. We discovered quite a number of cool applications, such as website translations that allow users to surf the web in a different language, and virtual pets that corresponded with users in Chinese.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
Some people who did not have much exposure had been able to get to quite a decent level of proficiency anyway and seemed to put this down to being "good at languages".

**One thing you're most proud of accomplishing:**\\
Good brainstorming process and identifying the only solution feasible to prototype in a short time

**Others:**\\
Big thank you to our friends and the Chinese language teachers who participated in our user research and gave us so many valuable insights.
