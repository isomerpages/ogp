#### What is Anything Mapper
Upload a list of locations & characteristics, and convert it into a map that others can search and filter.

#### Why Anything Mapper?
We realised existing map products didn’t allow you to easily filter for specific characteristics. We wanted an easy way to upload a list of locations and their characteristics (e.g. mosques, restrooms) and then convert that into a searchable, filterable map.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
There are actually many potential use cases for filterable maps. For example, bike routes of varying difficulty or for different types of bikes, hawker centers that are only open in the mornings or the evenings, and vaccination centers, handicapped-accessible washrooms and so on.
