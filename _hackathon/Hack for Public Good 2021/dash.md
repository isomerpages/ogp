#### What's Dash?
The common inbox for the government to address incoming queries. Dash streamlines the traditional product support inbox by allowing for multiple users to collaborate on a common inbox, automatically categorizing and tagging emails, and extracting insights on frequent email topics. 

#### What motivated you to build this product?
Product support does not have the right tool to optimise the amount of time spent on answering emails.

#### Most difficult aspect
It is hard to recommend tags based on the email content. The content needs to go through an email parser first to convert it to a json string before our classification algorithm can classify a new message based on user behavior for tagging.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
People hate outlook but they don't have an alternative
