#### What is Payments!
Payments combines two separate products under one roof: Ordering, which enables public-initiated payment on FormSG, and Billing, which allows agencies to create payment links to collect money from citizens efficiently and transparently. 

#### The most challenging aspects?

The key aspect that made it challenging to build something in the payments space was the user research. There are many requirements and stakeholders in the entire payment space; within the time constraints of the hackathon period, it was hard to scope out the entire field and come up with a production-grade product.

#### One thing you're most proud of accomplishing!
Getting up a production-grade payment demo up in a very short time
