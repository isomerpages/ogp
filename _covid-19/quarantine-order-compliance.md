[Homer](/products/homer/) was launched as an OGP Hackathon project at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to help reduce the spread of the virus by ensuring that potential carriers complied with their Quarantine Orders or Stay-Home-Notices. The monitoring can be done in 2 ways: 

**(1) The Spot-Check Method**

Sending SMSes at random times of the day containing a unique link. Users simply click on the link to share their current location.

**(2) The Constant Monitoring Solution**

Installation of an application on the users’ phones. The app automatically sends location reports every 5 minutes to the server. Users are also asked to submit health reports multiple times a day, together with a selfie for identification purposes.

With both solutions, data is reported to a dashboard for enforcement officers’ review. The system is currently used by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Education (MOE), Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM).


#### Our Impact
* Ensured compliance of over 300,000 Stay Home Notice (SHN) and Quarantine Orders
