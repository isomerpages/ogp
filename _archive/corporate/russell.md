accomplishments:
  - Revamped leadership meeting platforms to create a clearer cadence for organisation decision-making for an expanded team of senior leaders tackling the task of leading a rapidly expanded 180-pax organisation.
  - Pushed the Workplace, Finance, and People teams to get comfortable with rapid experimentation and design thinking so as to imagine and prototype new policies, processes, and tools within days and weeks as opposed to months and years.
  - Helped to secure OGP’s headcount and funding runway for a 200-pax organisation in the next 3 years
  
quote: I joined OGP in 2019, and have stayed since then because I think it is
  the government’s best shot today at breaking the mould on trying new ways for
  government organisations to work better, so that we can be a better public
  service.
