accomplishments:
  - Led the exploration, design, implementation and launch of Pair Search from 0-1. Designed a search retrieval + reranking methodology that was evaluated by the Vespa team as “state of the art”.
  - Led the implementation of Pair Assistant v2 and Document v2 features (in particular reducing hallucinations by leveraging on modern RAG/LLM research), as well as Pair Chat v2 UI/UX improvements (triaged, scheduled and addressed a large number of issues independently within a short time-frame of 2 weeks).
  - Shifted Pair Intern from it’s experimental code base to a full-fledged repo production infrastructure on GCC, and improving its email parsing and LLM generation behavior to eliminate user complaints on it’s instruction following.
