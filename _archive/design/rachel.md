accomplishments:
  - Designed, tested and contributed to code for different features in AskGov, which helped citizens find 136k answers/month (126% up from last cycle). Some key features designed and implemented this cycle were the whole-of-government AskGov landing page to find any answer regardless of agency, and timely interceptions of a possible answer when questions are asked. 
  - In 2 weeks, I scoped and designed 8 key flows for Rooster, which will be replacing the existing Healthcare Messaging System in July. By scoping down and designing a lean MVP in 2 weeks, this gave a good foundation for engineers to start on backend work, keeping us on track for a tight deadline. I iteratively designed while conducting user tests, correcting our logic gap and assumptions early, avoiding costly post-development changes. 
  - Conducted research for Pair Noms to establish benchmarks for what good meeting minutes look like, identify gaps in our current output, and demystify how to improve our LLM output, despite the 'black-box' nature of it. Systematically identified what needed to be changed when we were processing users' raw meeting transcripts and set better guidelines on what to process, in order to bring our LLM output closer to our benchmarks.
