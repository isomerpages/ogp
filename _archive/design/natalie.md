accomplishments:
  - Delivering the Glue:Cuciocity prototype to Jurong Regional Library and library@harboufront! I’m glad we pulled it off, and I learnt so much in the process of making my first exhibition piece!
  - Learnt how to make CSS keyframe animations! It’s speeding up the dev workflow with my engineers, and now feels like my secret super power.
  - Handed off Event Lists for CalSG! Feel like it could be a big differentiating feature, and am excited to see how users will use it.
