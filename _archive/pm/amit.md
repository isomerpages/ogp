accomplishments:
  - Propagated FormPay in various forums and prioritised key features for reaching PMF, to ensure exponential growth in the number of transactions (240% up), forms (590% up), agencies (257% up), and total payment amount (700% up) compared to the last cycle.
  - Submitted FormSG's application (and writeup) for UNDP Digital Public Good accreditation and kept following up for 9 months while facilitating various technical and documentation changes to ensure FormSG's successful accreditation as the 147th DPG in the world.
  - Signify, a product that I envisioned in early 2023 and launched in mid 2023 has been able to save $10M in planned cost by successfully piloting with various MOH institutions, on track to become the de-facto signing solution for PHIs.
