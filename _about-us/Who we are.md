### A modern tech team working on public sector problems

  
We are motivated by problems that have strong impact on the public. We listen to issues on the ground and take them back to experiment and develop technology for the public good. Our role is to accelerate the digital transformation of the Singapore Government by being a space where we can experiment with new tech practices, including new technologies, management techniques, corporate systems, and even cultural norms. Our end goal is that through our work, Singapore becomes a model of how governments can use technology to improve the public good.

### Problem solving is our core
We experiment with new practices to create successful products and demonstrate that they work, so that we can propagate our best practices to the rest of the public service and ultimately, accelerate the digitalization of the government. Solutions we have created include digitalising paper coupons and government forms, accelerating vaccination rollouts during the Covid-19 pandemic and blocking unsolicited messages and calls to prevent scams.

### Hack For Public Good
We encourage initiative in problem solving. That’s why we empower individuals to be creative in their approach to problem solving through our annual [Hack for Public Good](/hackathon/2022/). 

70% of our products come from this month-long event where we generate new ideas for products, conduct user research and build prototypes.

### Our people, our strength.

Our people are our most valuable asset. We ensure that every employee feels valued and trusted through open communication. We believe in a flat hierarchy where everyone is given the same autonomy to make decisions that maximises the impact of their work. Learning keeps the team growing. Apart from Learning Fridays and team syncs, OGP also has Learning Month- a whole month dedicated to either completing a course or improving on a skill of one’s choice. Some ran workshops while others conducted crash courses for the team. Ultimately, we aim to get everyone in the team to learn through creating an environment that encourages learning.
