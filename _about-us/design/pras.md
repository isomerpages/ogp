accomplishments:
  - Independently redesigned SGC with several new feature sets for over 200 agencies in a short span of 3-4 months, comprehensively tested by several agencies.
  - Maintained and lead a clear design direction for product despite constantly changing timelines, changing requirements or even changing policy about the scams and trust space.
  - Worked outside of design, by pushing frontend code for Postman and managing stakeholders so that my engineers can focus on more critical issues and product operations can spend less time answering questions.
